# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera

This repository contains source code, assignments, and notes from my journey through the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

## 📚 About the Specialization

The Deep Learning Specialization is a series of five courses that help you master deep learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. The courses cover:

- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Sequence Models

- Each folder corresponds to a specific course and week assignment.
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) contain the code and explanations for each assignment.
- Additional files and images are included as needed for each assignment.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Neural network basics and vectorized implementations
- Deep neural networks and initialization
- Regularization and optimization techniques
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition
- Residual networks and transfer learning
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, GRUs, and sequence modeling
- Attention mechanisms and Transformers
- Applications: image classification, face recognition, machine translation, named entity recognition, and more

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ngoc-minh-do/deep-learning-specialization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired assignment folder.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) using JupyterLab or VS Code.
4. Follow along with the code and explanations, or run the cells to experiment.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Matplotlib, h5py, PIL, SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn (requirements may vary by assignment)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(You may need to create this file based on your environment.)*

## 📖 Credits

- Assignments and course materials are based on the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng and deeplearning.ai.
- Some code and images are provided by Coursera for educational purposes.
